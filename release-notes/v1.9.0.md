This change aims to further enhance the performance of an already optimized library by introducing bitmap-based checks to significantly accelerate evaluation speed. Additionally, wildcard checks are now pre-computed during policy creation, reducing runtime overhead. Most importantly, the update drastically reduces memory usage for larger policies, especially those with fewer than 1,000 actions.

Note: since there is indexing cost with building the resourceIndex / actionIndex maps for huge policies ( e.g. 1000+ resources) this will have the following drawbacks:
1. addtional startup times of initializing the policy.
2. memory overhead R * A / 8 where R resources, A actions and the result is memory usage.
3. If policies are sprse: most roles have few permissions, bitmaps may waste memory on 0's bits. 

Default search still works for larger policies and it's more stable, but not as fast. 

### Bitmap Fundamentals
1. **What is a Bitmap?**
   - A compact array of bits (0s and 1s) where each bit represents a boolean state
   - In this context, each bit represents whether a specific (action Ã— resource) combination is permitted

2. **Why Use Bitmaps?**
   - **Space Efficient**: 32x more compact than boolean arrays (1 bit vs 4-8 bytes per permission)
   - **Fast Checks**: Bitwise operations are extremely fast (single CPU instruction)
   - **Cache Friendly**: More data fits in CPU cache lines

### BitmapPolicy Implementation
1. **Index Mapping**:
   ```javascript
   // Creates numeric indices for fast lookups
   this.resourceIndex = new Map(resources.map((r, i) => [r, i]));
   this.actionIndex = new Map(actions.map((a, i) => [a, i]));
   ```

2. **Permission Encoding**:
   - Each permission is encoded as `resource_index * num_actions + action_index`
   - Example: If "read"=index 0 and "post"=index 1, permission bit = `1 * 4 + 0 = 4`

3. **Policy Storage**:
   ```javascript
   // Stores multiple bitmaps per role
   this.policies = new Map();
   this.policies.set("admin", [bitmap1, bitmap2]);
   ```

### Library Integration
1. **Automatic Fallback System**:
   ```javascript
   // Only use bitmap if policy isn't too large
   if (policy.resources.length * policy.actions.length <= 10000) {
     this.bitmapPolicy = new BitmapPolicy(...);
   }
   ```

2. **Dual Checking Mechanism**:
   ```javascript
   grant() {
     // Try bitmap first
     if (this.policy.bitmapPolicy) {
       const bitmapGrant = this.bitmapSearch();
       if (bitmapGrant !== null) return bitmapGrant;
     }
     // Fallback to original
     return this.originalSearch();
   }
   ```

3. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Maintains original JSON policy structure
   - Preserves all existing API methods
   - No changes required in consumer code

### Performance Characteristics
| Operation | Original | Bitmap |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Memory Use | O(n) | O(n/32) |
| Check Speed | O(n) searches | O(1) bit check |
| Wildcards | Array scans | Pre-computed during policy creation |
